## Contributing

### Setting up the development environment

```
yarn install
```

### Submiting a patch

#### Commit messages

Farmblocks uses commitizen to help with the formatting of commit messages,
so instead of doing a ``git commit``, we ask you to please use the ``commit`` 
npm script instead:

```
yarn commit
```
