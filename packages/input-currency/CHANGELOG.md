### Features

* **CurrencyInput:** set default allowNegative to false ([d4c0795](https://github.com/CraveFood/farmblocks/commit/d4c0795))
* **input-currency:** use react-number-format as the auxiliary formatting lib ([7a5060b](https://github.com/CraveFood/farmblocks/commit/7a5060b)), closes [#640](https://github.com/CraveFood/farmblocks/issues/640)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **input-currency:** Previously we were using react-currency-input as the auxiliary formatting lib but it has a bug on
safari and the maintainer is no longer releasing new versions with bug fixes. So now we are using
react-number-format as the auxiliary lib - as consequence some properties have changed
