These components are expected to work on somewhat modern browsers, but if it breaks on a particular version of a particular browser, please [file an issue](https://github.com/CraveFood/farmblocks/issues), we can check the problem using [browserstack](http://browserstack.com/), that is a nice service and supports open source projects like this one :)
